Hand writing(Devenagri-Indian language) recognition with keras neural networks

The Code uses convolutional neural network to train a labeled dataset of handwriting images of devanagri script. Used libraries such Keras which uses Tensorflow.

This code can be executed on jupyter or any other notebook. I personally love spyder or rodeo. Its super easy if you are used to R-studio environment
