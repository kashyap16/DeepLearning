Hand writing(Devenagri-Indian language) recognition with keras neural networks

Objective is to identigy any handwritten numbers in devenagri(hindi) language. This language is widely used in India.
The Code uses convolutional neural network to train a labeled dataset of handwriting images of devanagri numbers (0 - 9). Used libraries such as Keras which uses Tensorflow.

Data contains images of handwritten numbers in hindi.

This code can be executed on jupyter or any other notebook.

You can get this dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Devanagari+Handwritten+Character+Dataset
